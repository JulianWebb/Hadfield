[Hadfield](https://github.com/JulianWebb/Hadfield/) is a [RFC1436](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc1436/)-compliant [Gopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)) server that utilitzes a File-Based design. The goal of the project is to bring a modern approach to the predecessor and competitor of HTTP while staying true to the ideas it was founded on.
